*seasonal* is an easy-to-use and full-featured R-interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS,
the newest seasonal adjustment software developed by the [United States Census
Bureau][census].

### Installation

*seasonal* depends on the [x13binary][x13binary] package to access pre-built
binaries of X-13ARIMA-SEATS on all platforms and does not require any manual
installation. To install both packages, type to the R console:

    install.packages("seasonal")

### Getting started

`seas` is the core function of the *seasonal* package. By default, `seas` calls
the automatic procedures of X-13ARIMA-SEATS to perform a seasonal adjustment
that works well in most circumstances:

    m <- seas(AirPassengers)

For a more detailed introduction, check our [article in the *Journal of
Statistical Software*](http://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v087.i11) or consider the
vignette:

    vignette("seas")

### Input

In *seasonal*, it is possible to use almost the complete syntax of X-13ARIMA-
SEATS. The X-13ARIMA-SEATS syntax uses *specs* and *arguments*, with each spec
optionally containing some arguments. These spec-argument combinations can be
added to `seas` by separating the spec and the argument by a dot (`.`). For
example, in order to set the 'variables' argument of the 'regression' spec equal
to `td` and `ao1999.jan`, the input to `seas` looks like this:

    m <- seas(AirPassengers, regression.variables = c("td", "ao1955.jan"))

The best way to learn about the relationship between the syntax of
X-13ARIMA-SEATS and *seasonal* is to study the [comprehensive list of examples][examples].
Detailed information on the options can be found in the Census Bureaus'
[official manual][manual].

### Output

*seasonal* has a flexible mechanism to read data from X-13ARIMA-SEATS. With the
`series` function, it is possible to import almost all output that can be
generated by X-13ARIMA-SEATS. For example, the following command returns the
forecasts of the ARIMA model as a `"ts"` time series:

    m <- seas(AirPassengers)
    series(m, "forecast.forecasts")

### Graphs

There are several graphical tools to analyze a `seas` model. The main plot
function draws the seasonally adjusted and unadjusted series, as well as the
outliers. Optionally, it also draws the trend of the seasonal decomposition:

    m <- seas(AirPassengers, regression.aictest = c("td", "easter"))
    plot(m)


### Graphical User Interface

The `view` function is a graphical tool for choosing a seasonal adjustment
model, using the new [seasonalview][seasonalview] package, with the same
structure as the [demo website of seasonal][seasweb]. To install
[seasonalview][seasonalview], type:

    install.packages("seasonalview")

The goal of `view` is to summarize all relevant options, plots and statistics
that should be usually considered. `view` uses a `"seas"` object as its main
argument:

    view(m)

### License and Credits

*seasonal* is free and open source, licensed under GPL-3. It requires the X
-13ARIMA-SEATS software by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is open source and
freely available under the terms of its own [license][license].
