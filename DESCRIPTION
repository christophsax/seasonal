Description: Easy-to-use interface to X-13-ARIMA-SEATS, the
    seasonal adjustment software by the US Census Bureau. It offers full
    access to almost all options and outputs of X-13, including X-11 and SEATS,
    automatic ARIMA model search, outlier detection and support for user
    defined holiday variables, such as Chinese New Year or Indian Diwali. It
    also includes a Shiny-based graphical user interface. Seasonal does not
    contain the binaries of X-13, which must be installed separately. See the
    README file or the vignette for installation notes.
Depends:
    R (>= 2.15)
Suggests:
    shiny (>= 0.11.1),
