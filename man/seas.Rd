\usage{
robust.seas(x, xreg = NULL, xtrans = NULL, seats.noadmiss = "yes",
  transform.function = "auto", regression.aictest = c("td", "easter"),
  outlier = "", automdl = "", na.action = na.omit, out = FALSE,

  outlier = "", automdl = "", na.action = na.omit, out = FALSE,
  dir = NULL, ..., list = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class \code{"ts"}: time series to seasonaly adjust.}

\item{xreg}{(optional) object of class \code{"ts"}: one or several user 
defined exogenous variables for regARIMA modelling, can be used both with 
\code{regression} or \code{x11regression}.}

\item{xtrans}{(optional) object of class \code{"ts"}: one or two user 
defined exogenous variables for the \code{transform} spec. Can be specifed 
together with \code{xreg}.}

\item{seats.noadmiss}{spec 'seats' with argument \code{noadmiss = "yes"} 
(default). Seasonal adjustment by SEATS, if SEATS decomposition is invalid,
an alternative model is used (a message is returned). If \code{noadmiss =
"no"}, no approximation is done. If the seats spec is removed 
(\code{seats = NULL}), no seasonal adjustment is performed.}

\item{transform.function}{spec \code{transform} with argument 
\code{function = "auto"} (default). Automatic log transformation detection.
Set equal to \code{"none"}, \code{"log"} or any value that is allowed by 
X-13 to turn it off.}

\item{regression.aictest}{spec \code{regression} with argument 
\code{aictest = c("td", "easter")} (default). AIC test for trading days and
Easter effects. Set equal to \code{NULL} to turn it off.}

\item{outlier}{spec \code{outlier} without arguments (default). Automatic 
oulier detection. Set equal to \code{NULL} to turn it off.}

\item{automdl}{spec \code{automdl} without arguments (default). Automatic 
model search with the automdl spec. Set equal to \code{NULL} to turn it off.}

\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data
contain NAs. \code{na.omit} (default), \code{na.exclude} or \code{na.fail}.
If \code{na.action = na.x13}, NA handling is done by X-13, i.e. NA values 
are substituted by -99999.}

\item{out}{logical, should the X-13ARIMA-SEATS standard output be saved in 
the \code{"seas"} object? (this increases object size substantially, it is 
recommended to re-evaluate the model using the \code{\link{out}} function 
instead.)}

\item{dir}{character string with a user defined file path. If specified, 
the X-13ARIMA-SEATS output files are copied to this folder. Useful for 
debugging.}

\item{...}{additional spec-arguments options sent to X-13ARIMA-SEATS (see 
details).}

\item{list}{a named list with additional spec-arguments options. This is an
alternative to the \code{...} argument. It is useful for programming.}
}
\value{
returns an object of class \code{"seas"}, essentially a list with the
  following components: 
  \item{series}{a list containing the output tables of X-13. To be accessed 
  by the \code{series} function.} 
  \item{data}{seasonally adjusted data, the 
  raw data, the trend component, the irregular component and the seasonal 
  component (deprecated).} 
  \item{err}{warning messages from X-13ARIMA-SEATS} 
  \item{udg}{content of the \code{.udg} output file} 
  \item{est}{content of the \code{.est} output file} 
  \item{lks}{content of the \code{.lks} output file} 
  \item{model}{list with the model specification, 
  similar to \code{"spc"}. It typically contains \code{"regression"}, which 
  contains the regressors and parameter estimates, and \code{"arima"}, which 
  contains the ARIMA specification and the parameter estimates.} 
  \item{fivebestmdl}{Best Five ARIMA Models (unparsed)} 
  \item{x}{input series}
  \item{spc}{object of class \code{"spclist"}, a list containing the content of the \code{.spc} file that is
  used by X-13ARIMA-SEATS. Each spec is on the first level, each 
  argument is on the second level.} 
  \item{call}{function call}
  \item{wdir}{temporary directory in which X-13ARIMA-SEATS has been run}
  
  The \code{final} function returns the final adjusted series, the 
  \code{plot} method shows a plot with the unadjusted and the adjusted 
  series. \code{summary} gives an overview of the regARIMA model.

\description{
`robust.seas` is a \emph{highly experimental} utilitly function with the same
usage as seas, but will always work. In case of a failing of `seas` it will
try an alternative strategy, with a message.

Core function of the seasonal package. With the default options, \code{seas} calls the 
automatic procedures of X-13ARIMA-SEATS to perform a seasonal adjustment that
works well in most circumstances. Via the \code{...} argument, it is possible
to invoke almost all options that are available in X-13ARIMA-SEATS (see 
details). The default options of \code{seas} are listed as explicit arguments and are 
discussed in the arguments section.
}
\details{
It is possible to use the almost complete syntax of X-13ARIMA-SEAT via the 
\code{...} argument. The syntax of X-13ARIMA-SEATS uses \emph{specs} and 
\emph{arguments}, and each spec optionally contains some arguments. In 
\code{seas}, an additional spec-argument can be added by separating spec and 
argument by a dot (\code{.}) (see examples). Alternatvily, spec-argument 
combinations can be supplied as a named list, which is useful for programming.

Similarily, the 
\code{\link{series}} function can be used to read almost all series from 
X-13ARIMA-SEATS.

For a more extensive description, consider the vignette or the wiki page, 
which contains replications of almost all examples from the official 
X-13ARIMA-SEATS manual.
